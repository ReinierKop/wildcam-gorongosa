    Humans coexist with nature and sometimes these humans, or their vehicles, are also captured in trail camera photos. As a national park, Gorongosa attracts tourists from around the world who go on safari on the roads within the park. This tourism industry is supported by staff who guide tourists, provide hospitality, and maintain infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, electricity, and water lines. Other staff that are critical to the future of the park are the rangers, scientists, and conservationists who regularly do work in remote areas of the park. In Gorongosa, local people live in villages near the park where they grow crops and depend on the land for their livelihood. They also have to adapt to wildlife that moves between the park and their villages.
