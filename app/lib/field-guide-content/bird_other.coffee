  description: '''
    Birds are warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrates that have evolved numerous adaptations for flight, including wings, powerful muscles, hollow bones, and, most distinctively, feathers. While all birds have feathers and wings, not all birds can fly, and there are also notable exceptions of birds that have lost (or partially lost) the trait of hollow bones. Birds comprise some 10,000 species worldwide, about 2,000 of which have been recorded in Africa. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 12 percent of birds worldwide are known to be threatened or extinct.
