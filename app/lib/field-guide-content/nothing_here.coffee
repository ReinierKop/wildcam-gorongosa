    Even if a trail camera photo has no animals in it, you can still admire Gorongosaâ€™s magnificent landscapes. Gorongosa National Park lies on the southern end of the Great Rift Valley, which created a rich mosaic of soils and a varied landscape. This diversity of landscapes is what gives rise to the incredible diversity of wildlife and makes makes Gorongosa truly unique.

    The park has 21 distinct plant communities, ranging from the tall, humid rainforest on the slopes of Mount Gorongosa, to dry woodland savanna of the Cheringoma Plateau, to extensive, flat grasslands on the floodplains of Lake Urema. Each creates a different habitat and supports a different variety of animals.
